## Recommendation

For a large user base managing VPN services, **Marzban-Shop** is the recommended choice for the following reasons:

1. **Scalability**: The MySQL database and containerized architecture can handle a large number of concurrent users and transactions more efficiently.

2. **VPN Integration**: Native integration with Marzban panel provides automated subscription management and multi-protocol support.

3. **Payment Security**: Robust payment system with proper security measures and webhook support is crucial for handling financial transactions at scale.

4. **User Management**: Automated notifications and subscription tracking help manage a large user base more effectively.

5. **Modern Architecture**: The modern tech stack provides better performance, security, and maintainability.

While Gods-Shop has excellent features for a general e-commerce bot, its architecture and technology choices make it less suitable for managing a large VPN service. The SQLite database and older technology stack could become bottlenecks as the user base grows.

### Implementation Considerations

If choosing Marzban-Shop, consider:

1. Setting up proper monitoring and alerting
2. Implementing database backups and redundancy
3. Adding custom admin features if needed
4. Scaling the infrastructure based on user load
5. Regular security audits and updates

The higher initial setup complexity of Marzban-Shop is outweighed by its better scalability and VPN-specific features for managing a large user base.
