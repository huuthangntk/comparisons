### Summary and Recommendation

For your specific case with a large user base, I recommend going with the **Marzban Shop Bot** for the following reasons:

1. **Direct VPN Integration**: The direct integration with Marzban panel is crucial for managing a large user base efficiently. This automation will save significant administrative time and reduce errors.

2. **Payment Flexibility**: With multiple payment gateway support and flexible pricing, it better serves a diverse user base.

3. **Simpler Architecture**: While this might seem like a con, for a VPN service it's actually beneficial - simpler systems tend to be more reliable and easier to maintain.

4. **Modern Framework**: The use of aiogram 3.1.1 provides better performance and stability for handling many concurrent users.

5. **Automated Management**: The built-in notification system and automated subscription management are essential for handling a large user base.

While Greed is a more feature-rich and robust system overall, it's designed as a general-purpose shop bot. The Marzban Shop Bot is purpose-built for VPN services, making it a better fit for your specific use case.

Key success factors:
1. You'll need to implement proper monitoring and backup systems
2. Consider adding load balancing if user count is very high
3. Implement additional security measures
4. Set up proper logging and monitoring
5. Regular maintenance and updates will be crucial

The Marzban Shop Bot's focused feature set and direct VPN integration make it the better choice for managing a large VPN user base, despite having fewer general features than Greed.
