# Summary and Recommendation

Given your requirement of managing a large user base, I recommend going with **Marzban-Shop Bot** for the following reasons:

1. **Performance at Scale**
- Better suited for handling high concurrent users
- Lower resource consumption
- Faster response times due to simpler architecture
- More efficient database operations

2. **Operational Simplicity**
- Easier to maintain and troubleshoot
- Less complex deployment
- Fewer dependencies to manage
- More straightforward update process

3. **Essential Features**
- Includes all critical features for VPN service management
- Multi-language support for broader user base
- Multiple payment options
- Built-in notification system

4. **User Management**
- More streamlined user flow
- Better suited for handling large numbers of subscriptions
- Efficient subscription tracking and management
- Built-in expiry notifications

While Wave-Shop Bot offers more features and better admin tools, these advantages come at the cost of performance and complexity, which could become problematic with a large user base. The additional features it offers (like discount codes and detailed analytics) could be added to Marzban-Shop if needed, while maintaining its performance advantages.

For a large user base, the primary concerns should be:
1. Performance and stability
2. Efficient resource usage
3. Reliable user management
4. Quick response times
5. Easy maintenance

Marzban-Shop better addresses these core needs while remaining simpler to maintain and scale. Its webhook-based architecture and lighter footprint make it more suitable for handling a large number of users efficiently.

The missing features in Marzban-Shop (like advanced analytics or discount systems) could be added as separate microservices if needed, without compromising the core system's performance and reliability.
